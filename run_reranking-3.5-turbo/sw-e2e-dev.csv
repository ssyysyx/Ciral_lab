President Trump told reporters in Washington that COVID-19 has affected the United States more than the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941 or the September 11 terrorist attack by the al-Qaeda group under Osama bin Laden.

The then US President, Bill Clinton, once called this case one of the greatest regrets of his presidency. It is no wonder that after his retirement, much of his humanitarian work for his Clinton Foundation has been concentrated in the country. The Rwandan civil war in 1990 saw a group of Tutsi-led rebels under Paul Kagame, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) flee to Uganda, fighting the Rwandan government of President Juvenal Habyarimana, who is a Hutu. The RPF's goals were to overthrow the French-backed government and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) then known as Zaire.

He added that the government is not capable of providing basic services, nor is it capable of stopping the wave of unrest.

He stressed that, in this sense, the two-wife policy is not feasible, as there are not enough women and the numbers are not consistent. He said the widespread perception that women appear to outnumber men is due to social and economic factors. He said men are more vulnerable than women because many of them are incarcerated, addicted to drugs, unemployed, while society demands that women marry someone with power. ""So it\'s men who are most affected by the problem of poverty, many men are unable to afford families and take care of them, so they either don\'t marry or they leave their families, so if you look you find men, but many are not able to marry, white people say \'eligible bachelors\'"", wrote Professor Tibaijuka.

Content: Even intellectually, many African scholars have had different views on the wealth of this continent, while scholars from other continents see Africa as a continent blessed with diverse resources. African scholars view Africa as a continent of natural decay, unbuilt to compete with other continents economically, politically, socially, culturally and even intellectually. One of the African scholars, Professor Patrice Lumumba (PLO), has been quoted as saying that the chaos in Africa is the result of poor attitudes of those in power, saying they lack a good vision to achieve the continent\'s aspirations. ""The problem of Africa is that those in power lack knowledge, but those with knowledge lack power"", says PLO addressing international academics at the University of Dar es Salaam. Lumumba\'s attitude to Africa\'s problems is the result of the intellectual poverty of its leaders who are opposed to the common people with a vision that would be respected by the leaders, would change this continent.
