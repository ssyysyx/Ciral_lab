      "The old, dusty attic of her grandmother's house always felt like a portal to another world. Ten-year-old Lily loved the smell of mothballs and the creaking floorboards, the way sunlight slanted through cracks in the boarded-up window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. \n",
      "\n",
      "Today, she was on a mission. Her grandmother had mentioned a \"special treasure\" hidden in the attic, but hadn't given any further clues. After hours of sifting through cobwebs and forgotten trinkets, Lily stumbled upon a plain, brown backpack tucked behind a chest. It was worn and faded, almost invisible against the dusty backdrop.\n",
      "\n",
      "As she lifted it, a wave of warmth washed over her, making her feel strangely connected to the bag. The leather felt soft and pliable, and the worn zipper slid open with a gentle sigh. Inside, nestled amongst moth-eaten blankets, lay a dusty, leather-bound book. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lily opened the book. It was filled with faded ink, strange symbols, and beautifully drawn maps. As she traced her finger along the maps, a spark of excitement ignited within her. The maps depicted fantastical landscapes, soaring mountains, and hidden waterfalls.  \n",
      "\n",
      "That night, Lily couldn't sleep. The maps haunted her dreams, filled with vibrant colours and sounds of distant waterfalls. She longed to explore the worlds they depicted. \n",
      "\n",
      "The next morning, she grabbed the backpack, the book tucked inside, and headed out to her favorite spot, a clearing in the woods behind her house. She unzipped the backpack, and as she did, a faint shimmer danced around the edges of the leather. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lily reached out, her hand disappearing into the backpack. She pulled it back, finding her hand covered in a layer of shimmering dust. She brushed it off, then looked inside again. The backpack was empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, she felt a gentle tug. Lily took a step forward, and the world around her shifted. The trees were gone, replaced by a towering mountain range. The air was filled with the sound of rushing water. She looked around, amazed. The map in her backpack was leading her to the place it depicted! \n",
      "\n",
      "Over the next few days, Lily explored different worlds. She climbed snow-capped mountains, navigated through dense rainforests, and even flew on the back of a giant, friendly dragon. Each time, she returned to the clearing in the woods, the magic backpack transporting her back home. \n",
      "\n",
      "But as time passed, Lily realized the magic backpack wasn't just a tool for adventure, it was a key to her own imagination. It allowed her to experience worlds she had only dreamed of, to face her fears, and to become a bolder, more adventurous version of herself. \n",
      "\n",
      "The backpack became Lily's secret, a symbol of the boundless possibilities that lay within her. She knew that even when she couldn't travel to these fantastical places, she could still carry the magic of exploration with her, forever inspired by the worlds her backpack revealed. \n",

      "### How to Use\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Save the Script:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   Save the above script to a file named `transpose_matrix.sh`. You can use `nano`, `vim`, or any text editor of your choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   nano transpose_matrix.sh\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Make the Script Executable:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   Modify the file permissions to make the script executable.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   chmod +x transpose_matrix.sh\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Run the Script:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   Execute the script by passing the matrix string as an argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```bash\n",
      "   ./transpose_matrix.sh '[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]'\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "   **Output:**\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   [1,3,5],[2,4,6]\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Explanation of the Script\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Input Validation:**\n",
      "   \n",
      "   The script first checks if exactly one argument is provided. If not, it displays the usage instruction and exits.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Preprocessing the Input:**\n",
      "   \n",
      "   - It removes the leading `[` and trailing `]` from the input string.\n",
      "   - It replaces the `],[` separator with a newline character to split the string into separate rows.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Transposing with `awk`:**\n",
      "   \n",
      "   - The `awk` command reads each row, splits it by commas, and stores the elements in a two-dimensional array `matrix`.\n",
      "   - It keeps track of the maximum number of columns (`max_cols`) and rows (`max_rows`).\n",
      "   - In the `END` block, it iterates over the columns and rows to construct the transposed matrix, formatting it back into the specified string format.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Output:**\n",
      "   \n",
      "   Finally, the script echoes the transposed matrix.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Handling Edge Cases\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Different Matrix Sizes:**\n",
      "  \n",
      "  The script is designed to handle matrices of different sizes as long as they are properly formatted.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Multiple Digits and Negative Numbers:**\n",
      "  \n",
      "  It correctly handles elements with multiple digits and negative signs.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Irregular Matrices:**\n",
      "  \n",
      "  The script assumes that the input matrix is well-formed (i.e., each row has the same number of elements). If the rows have varying lengths, the behavior is undefined and may result in an incomplete transpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Usage\n",
      "\n",
      "```bash\n",
      "./transpose_matrix.sh '[10,20,30],[40,50,60]'\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Output:**\n",
      "\n",
      "```\n",
      "[10,40],[20,50],[30,60]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This script provides a straightforward and efficient way to transpose a matrix represented as a string in Bash using standard UNIX utilities like `sed` and `awk`.\n"
